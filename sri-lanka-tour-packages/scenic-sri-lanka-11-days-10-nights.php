                                                airport, your hotel, or your preferred meeting point and take you to
                                                Anuradhapura.</p>

                                            <p>The ancient city of Anuradhapura, in the central northern region of Sri
                                                Lanka, served as the country's first capital. One of Sri Lanka's
                                                original capitals, it served as a significant hub for Theravada Buddhism
                                                for hundreds of years. UNESCO recognized the Sacred City of Anuradhapura
                                                as a World Heritage Site in 1982 due to the ancient Sri Lankan
                                                civilization that once stood there.

                                                enshrined. The temple is exquisitely designed with ornamental stonework,

                                            <p>Kandy is a city with many cultures and one of the well-known main cities
                                                in Sri Lanka and is located in the heart of Sri Lanka. Since the
                                                Buddha's sacred tooth relic is housed there, Kandy has gained additional
                                                notoriety as a holy city. We'll take you to the Pinnawala Elephant
                                                Orphanage, the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya and the
                                                Temple of the Tooth, where a sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha is
                                                enshrined. The temple is exquisitely designed with ornamental stonework,
                                                a golden roof, and polished wood.
