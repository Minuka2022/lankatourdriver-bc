                                                Anuradhapura.</p>

                                            <p>The ancient city of Anuradhapura, in the central northern region of Sri
                                                Lanka, served as the country's first capital. One of Sri Lanka's
                                                original capitals, it served as a significant hub for Theravada Buddhism
                                                for hundreds of years. UNESCO recognized the Sacred City of Anuradhapura
                                                as a World Heritage Site in 1982 due to the ancient Sri Lankan
                                                civilization that once stood there.

                                                in Sri Lanka and is located in the heart of Sri Lanka. Since the
                                                Buddha's sacred tooth relic is housed there, Kandy has gained additional
                                                notoriety as a holy city. We'll take you to the Pinnawala Elephant

                                                enshrined. The temple is exquisitely designed with ornamental stonework,
                                                a golden roof, and polished wood.
