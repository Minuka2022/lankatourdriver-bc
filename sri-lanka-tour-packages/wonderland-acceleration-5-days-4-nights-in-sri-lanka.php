                                            <p>Kandy is a city with many cultures and one of the well-known main cities
                                                in Sri Lanka and is located in the heart of Sri Lanka. Since the
                                                Buddha's sacred tooth relic is housed there, Kandy has gained additional
                                                notoriety as a holy city. We'll take you to the Pinnawala Elephant
                                                Orphanage, the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya and the
                                                Temple of the Tooth, where a sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha is
                                                enshrined. The temple is exquisitely designed with ornamental stonework,
                                                a golden roof, and polished wood.</p>

                                                around the famous streets of Fort and Pettah, where you can buy almost
                                                anything, from street food and electronics to clothes and books.</p>

                                            <p>You will also see how Colombo is a mix of different cultures and
                                                religions through its colonial buildings and places of worship. Temples,
                                                Kovils, Mosques, and Churches can be found all over the city, and each
