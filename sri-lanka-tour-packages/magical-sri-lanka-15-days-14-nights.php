                                            <p>Your tour expert from Lanka Tour Driver will pick you up from the
                                                airport, your hotel, or your preferred meeting point and take you to
                                                Anuradhapura.</p>

                                            <p>The ancient city of Anuradhapura, in the central northern region of Sri
                                                Lanka, served as the country's first capital. One of Sri Lanka's
                                                original capitals, it served as a significant hub for Theravada Buddhism
                                                for hundreds of years. UNESCO recognized the Sacred City of Anuradhapura
                                                as a World Heritage Site in 1982 due to the ancient Sri Lankan
                                                civilization that once stood there.

                                            <p>Jaffna is a city on Sri Lanka's northern tip. The Nallur Kandaswamy Hindu
                                                temple is very big and has golden arches and a beautiful gopuram tower.
                                                The star-shaped Jaffna Fort, located on the coast, was originally
                                                constructed by the Portuguese in the 17th century but was subsequently
                                                occupied by the Dutch and British. The Jaffna Public Library is a sign
                                                of how the city has changed since the war. There are Dutch cannons and
                                                pre-colonial artefacts in the Jaffna Archaeological Museum.</p>
