                                            <p>Your tour expert from Lanka Tour Driver will pick you up from the
                                                airport, your hotel, or your preferred meeting point and take you to
                                                Kandy.</p>
                                            <p>Kandy is a city with many cultures and one of the well-known main cities
                                                in Sri Lanka and is located in the heart of Sri Lanka. Since the
                                                Buddha's sacred tooth relic is housed there, Kandy has gained additional
                                                notoriety as a holy city. We'll take you to the Pinnawala Elephant
                                                Orphanage, the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya and the
                                                Temple of the Tooth, where a sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha is
                                                enshrined. The temple is exquisitely designed with ornamental stonework,
                                                a golden roof, and polished wood.</p>

                                                can have a great time with plenty of hotels, villas, and luxury resorts.

                                            <p>Boat safaris in Bentota are very popular because of the nearby Madu
                                                River. Bentota is popular for water sports like Jet Skiing, Banana
                                                Boating, Kite Surfing, and Sea Plane Tours. The stunning home and garden
                                                of world-renowned architect Jeffery Bawa render you speechless. The
                                                turtle conservation project is a significant factor in the region. The
                                                only things that break up the long stretches of golden sand are
                                                corkscrew palms and the occasional granite outcrop.
