                    <p>The local people in the country speak several languages because Sri Lanka is a multi-national
                        county. Sri Lanka is populated with Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people.
                        They have different cultures, Religions and languages.

                    <p>Most Sri Lankans can not speak English.
                        Especially the people in rural areas do not speak English.
                        But English is a good language popular among the city people in Sri Lanka.
                        Besides, nowadays, most Sri Lankans speak English little by little

                    <p>Yes, you do need a tourist visa to enter the country for a short time to go on a trip, see the
                        sights, take a vacation, or visit friends.<br>

                    <h3 class="clr-pm">Is it safe to drink tap water in Sri Lanka?</h3 class="clr-pm">
                    <p>Sometimes yes and sometimes no, So I recommend you to drink bottled water with quality
                        certificates like SLS or ISO.
                        Itâ€™s more safer than drinking the tap water. If not you can use the filtered water provided by
                        government services in some areas.
