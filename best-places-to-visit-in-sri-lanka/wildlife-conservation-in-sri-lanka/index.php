          <h3>Snake Conservation Projects</h3>
          <p>Snakes, if we're talking about it, are widespread in many parts of the world. There are 96 snake species
            found in Sri Lanka out of the 246 species of snakes that have been identified worldwide. In fact, the vast
            majority of these species are found only in Sri Lanka.

            Perhaps you and I will be among those who fear snakes simply because we don't know for sure whether or not
            they are venomous.

          </p>

          <p>This led to widespread indiscriminate killing, with no thought given to which side the snake actually
            belonged to.

            The majority of snakes in Sri Lanka, despite their terrifying appearance, are actually quite harmless.
            The country is home to a small number of snake species, some of which are venomous.
          </p>


          <p>The most important thing to remember is that snakes and humans don't mix. If people get rattled, they kill
            the snake, and if the snake gets scared, it bites.

            Consequently, it is crucial that they be permitted to reside in their preferred areas of safety.
          </p>

          <p>

            The goal of these conservation efforts is to help both people and snakes.
            Without causing any harm to the snake, we can safely report it to them, and they will come and safely
            capture it.

            After that, the snake is relocated to a less populated area where it can thrive, giving everyone involved a
            better chance at a happy and healthy existence.
          </p>

          <p>When snakes are injured, conservation officers provide first aid. Once the animal is healthy again, it is
            transferred to a setting like the one described above.

            It is their responsibility to protect snakes from extinction, as many snake species are threatened in Sri
            Lanka. This is especially important because most of these snakes are endemic to the island nation.

            Are you interested in visiting the snake preservation centres..?
            Thelijjavila Snake Farm (not a farm at all but a conservation effort, only a concern in their name, so let's
            go!)
          </p>

          <p>Let's go if you're interested in learning more about these harmless creatures and getting up close and
            personal with them during a safari. They've thought of everything, including carrying emergency medications
            in case of a snake bite.
          </p>
          <p>If you're interested in seeing the animals and observing them up close and personal, or if you feel the
            need to learn more about them, then come on and let's go where all the necessary precautions have been
            taken.
          </p>

          <p>They don't mean any harm at all.
            To be on the safe side in the event of a snake bite, they even carry immediate treatment medications.

          <h3>Turtle Conservation Projects</h3>

          <p>To protect the marine turtles, programs for their preservation have been launched on Sri Lanka's southern
            coast.

            The primary goals of these places are to safeguard the sea turtles that come to the coastline to deposit
            their eggs.</p>

            alt="Turtle Conservation Projects - Sri Lanka" class="itinerary-day-img" width="400px" />
          <p>It became extremely crucial to manage the nesting grounds and support the protection of the species because
            Sri Lanka's beaches are home to 5 of the 7 endangered turtle species.

            You can touch, tame, and pet the tiny newborn turtles for a short while while following the officers'
            directions if you'd like to attend these turtle conservation programs.

          <h3>Udawala Elephant Orphanage</h3>

          <p>The Udawala elephant orphanage is also known as the elephant transit home since it is where ailing and
            orphaned elephants are treated before being sent to uninhabited jungle sections.

            They have the same exhibits as the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage. Elephants that are sick or orphaned are fed
            here and cared after until they are healthy enough to be released back into the wild. You are welcome to
            visit the centre during the feeding hours of 10.30 am, 2.30 pm, and 6.30 pm.</p>
