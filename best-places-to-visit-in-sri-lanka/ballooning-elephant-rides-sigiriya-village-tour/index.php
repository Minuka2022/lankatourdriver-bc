            <h3>Sigiriya Village Tour</h3>
            <p> The Sigiriya village tour will give you a memorable experience in this rural village. I'm glad to inform
              you
              that the
              paddy fields around this beautiful village will give you a joyful feeling you
              never had before. Bullock cart rides would be a different travel experience for your entire
              life. Even most of the city people in Sri Lanka still haven't gotten this fantastic experience. A
              traditional
              catamaran ride in Giritale lake will add excellent mind
              relaxation to your holiday.</p>

            <h3>Elephant Rides</h3>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, the elephant has long served as a vital work animal. When it comes to moving large objects,
              the mahouts who guide elephants spend their entire lives working with the same animal. Now is the day to
              take advantage of the gentle elephant and ride on it. As the massive animal silently moves through the
              jungle and along the river, you can relax and take in the sights from the comfort of your back.</p>

            <img class="attraction-img_within"

              alt="Elephant Ride - Sri Lanka" class="itinerary-day-img" />

            <p>A ride close to Sigiriya Rock is an absolute must. The monolith provides a stunning backdrop for
              photographs. Typically, the elephant will learn a few tricks from the mahout. Elephant rides are available
              on a number of Southwest coast beaches. Happiness awaits newlyweds and
              honeymooners who choose to ride an elephant.</p>
