              alt="Kandy to Ella - Blue train - Sri Lanka" class="attraction-img_within" />
            <p>The train ride from Kandy to Ella is the most beautiful in Sri Lanka,

              you will see the most beautiful green color & the plantations, mountains, and valleys on the way.
              I think itâ€™s the perfect way to experience Sri Lankan life.
              Because inside the train, you will meet smiling locals. and you can try local snacks from the local
              vendors who get into the train from the stations you pass.

              You will meet local people from different statuses on this journey.
              And I'm sure they will greet you with an honest smile.</p>

            <p>Don't forget to wave your hands to the running children after the train; This is a must-do experience
              in Sri Lanka;

              From Kandy to Ella, it will take around 7 hours.
              Little by little, you will feel that you are going high and high.

              Take a deep breath this time to enjoy the smell of the tea plantations and the wildflowers on the
              way.</p>

            <p>Make sure you keep your cameras ready to capture the beautiful hilltop villages and also the glittery
              waterfalls.

              If you need to save your time to do something more in Kandy city no matter, we can drop you at the
              Nanuoya railway station situates in Nuwara Eliya,
              because it is still awe-inspiring and beautiful the rest of this journey from Nanu Oya to Ella.
            </p>
