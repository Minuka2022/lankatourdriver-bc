          <p>You may get a breathtaking panorama of Kandy from Kandy View Point. Visit early or late to see the sunrise

          <p>One of the best places to take pictures is this well-known vantage point on Rajapihilla Street.
            The lake and the temple housing the tooth relic are also worth photographing, so remember to do so. This
            vantage point offers the best overview of the entire city, making it ideal for planning excursions.
            This lookout is also known as Arthur's Seat.
            It stands 550 meters above the ground. And it is commonly thought to be the highest point in all of Kandy.
